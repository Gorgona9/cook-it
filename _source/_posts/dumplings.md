Prepare ingredients for making potato dumplings with meat filling.
Combine minced meat with onion and grind until smooth. Then add salt and pepper to taste.
Peel potatoes with a brush, wash well.

Place in cold water and cook until done. Check the doneness of the jacket potatoes with a thin knife blade. You can boil pre-peeled potatoes.
When the potatoes are done, drain the water, peel the potatoes and mash the hot potatoes into a puree. There should be no lumps left in the mass. Let the puree cool.
Then add eggs, semolina, flour, salt to taste. Mix and knead the dough to a uniform consistency. It is better to pour in the flour gradually, do not add a lot, so as not to spoil the taste of the dumplings. The dough should come off your hands. The remaining flour can be used to form the dumplings.

Roll small balls of the minced meat, the size of a walnut.
Then wrap each ball in potato dough. It is convenient to do this by rolling the meat ball in flour before wrapping it in a potato layer.
Give the potato balls with filling a round shape.

At this time, bring a fairly large amount of water to a boil, add salt and bay leaf. Now carefully lower the dumplings into the water, so much so that the balls float freely. Stir gently so that the dumplings do not stick to the bottom. Bring to a boil, and when the dumplings float, reduce the heat and cook for 10 minutes on low heat.
